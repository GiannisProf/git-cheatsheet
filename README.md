# Git Cheatsheet

This file contains usefull commands that are needed to successfully use Git and Github. It contains 3 main workflows that most users encounter (repo initialization, cloning of existing repos and working with branches). There are also some extra commands that may seem usefull.

Created mainly as part of my refreshing of Git knowledge due to a long time absense from being a developer.
